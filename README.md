# Assignment 3 - Synchronization

This is another assignment I completed for my Ooperating Systems Class, and this program
artificially creates a race condition in order to practice synchronization across threads.
The program artificially creates a race condition by having two threads write to the
same .txt file at the same time and then uses mutexes to create a critical
section to prevent the race condition.
