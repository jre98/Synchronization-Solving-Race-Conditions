Hi again professor,
This is my assignment 3 submission. This program is a simple program that is
used to practice process synchronization between threads using mutuxes. The
program artificially creates a race condition by having two threads write to the
same .txt file at the same time and then uses mutexes to create a critical
section to prevent the race condition. I don't feel like there is much else to
be said, as the program is relatively straightforward. As always, please feel
free to reach out to me with any issues you might have with my program.
